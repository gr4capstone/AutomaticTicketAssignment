### Greetings! Please read the following to understand the directory structure:<br>
The root directory contains all the jupyter notebooks. We have 6 parts for the project. All the noteooks are well documented. Lets get started:<br><br>
<b>1) M1(part1) - Preprocessing and Visualization.ipynb</b><br>
Start with this notebook. This is milestone-1 part-1. It contains all the Visualisations, Data Pre-processing and Exploration.<br><br>

<b>2) M1(part2a) - Base Model Approach 1.ipynb</b><br>
This is the following notebook. This is milestone-1 part-2a. As the name suggests, it contains our first set of base models which are traditional machine learning models, implemented with BagOfWords and Tf-Idf transformation.<br><br>

<b>3) M1(part2b) - Base Model Approach 2.ipynb</b><br>
This is milestone-1 part-2b. In 2nd set of base models we went for deep learning architecture; LSTMs.<br><br>

<b>4) M2(part1) - Model Tuning.ipynb</b><br>
This is milestone-2 part-1. After all the exploration and model analysis we finalised LSTMs to be the model of our choice. Continuing with LSTMs, we first tuned the LSTM for the best architecture in this part. We tried various architectures which are explained in details in this notebook.<br><br>

<b>5) M2(part2) - Model Tuning.ipynb</b><br>
This is milestone-2 part-2. After deciding upon the apt architecture in previous part, we explored the learning rate, tried different optimizers and did sanity checks of our model in this notebook. The aim was to hit the right learning rate and go for longer training sessions with various callbacks in order to avoid overfitting and best generalize the model. Detailed analysis can be found in this notebook.<br><br>

<b>6) M2(part3) - Model Tuning.ipynb</b><br>
This is milestone-2 part-3. Shortcomings from previous part are attended in this notebook. We closed the project with 92% accuracy and 93% macro fi-score on the test set.
