lpal9516827/45.25.35.0499 has likely been infected with the locky ransomware.\n","\n","\n","the outbound http traffic from the infected device contained the following method data:\n","protocol:

notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal).\n","\n","sincerely,\n","secureworks ctoc\n","\n","\n","=========================\n","technical details\n","=========================\n","locky is a new ransomware that encrypts your data using aes encryption and then demands a form of digital currency to decrypt your files. locky is distributed by malicious attachments to spam emails and recently seen in massive phishing campaigns with microsoft word document attachments. ctu researchers have observed attachments (for example, inwarehouse_tool_j-81076273.doc) with embedded macro code used to download the locky payload. filenames seem to be constructed by using eight random numbers following \"inwarehouse_tool_j-\". a potential victim receiving the attachment needs to open it and enable the macro which will then initiate the payload download over http.\n","\n","once locky is running on the compromised system, it drops a copy of itself in the %temp% directory under the affected user's profile and sets a registry run key to ensure persistence across reboots. the dropped file has used the filenames ladybi.exe and svchost.exe. locky also sets the hkcu\\software\\locky registry key and creates the values listed in the ctu tips article provided in the references section. \n","\n","locky also checks for the following registry keys, which may indicate the presence of security-related software:\n","• software\\kasperskylab\n","• software\\eset\n","• software\\avast software\n","\n","the victim is notified of the infection when the desktop background image changes (see figure 4 in ctu tips). locky places the same instructions in a text file and a bitmap image on the desktop and displays both of these files to the victim.\n","\n","there is unconfirmed speculation that the operators of the botnet distributing the locky malware are also responsible for the bugat v5 (dridex) banking trojan. the spam emanates from the same botnet that distributes bugat v5 and other threats such as the shiz/shifu malware, but this finding is not conclusive because the botnet is used by various affiliates at different times.\n","\n","locky may also have the capability to locate network resources and encrypt files in those locations. ctu researchers are analysing a block of code that may be used to enumerate network-based locations (2016-02-19).\n","\n","locky attempts encryption on the following files and file types:\n","

lpal9516827/45.25.35.0499 has likely been infected with the locky ransomware.\n","\n","\n","the outbound http traffic from the infected device contained the following method data:\n","protocol:

notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal).\n","\n","sincerely,\n","secureworks ctoc\n","\n","\n","=========================\n","technical details\n","=========================\n","locky is a new ransomware that encrypts your data using aes encryption and then demands a form of digital currency to decrypt your files. locky is distributed by malicious attachments to spam emails and recently seen in massive phishing campaigns with microsoft word document attachments. ctu researchers have observed attachments (for example, inwarehouse_tool_j-81076273.doc) with embedded macro code used to download the locky payload. filenames seem to be constructed by using eight random numbers following \"inwarehouse_tool_j-\". a potential victim receiving the attachment needs to open it and enable the macro which will then initiate the payload download over http.\n","\n","once locky is running on the compromised system, it drops a copy of itself in the %temp% directory under the affected user's profile and sets a registry run key to ensure persistence across reboots. the dropped file has used the filenames ladybi.exe and svchost.exe. locky also sets the hkcu\\software\\locky registry key and creates the values listed in the ctu tips article provided in the references section. \n","\n","locky also checks for the following registry keys, which may indicate the presence of security-related software:\n","• software\\kasperskylab\n","• software\\eset\n","• software\\avast software\n","\n","the victim is notified of the infection when the desktop background image changes (see figure 4 in ctu tips). locky places the same instructions in a text file and a bitmap image on the desktop and displays both of these files to the victim.\n","\n","there is unconfirmed speculation that the operators of the botnet distributing the locky malware are also responsible for the bugat v5 (dridex) banking trojan. the spam emanates from the same botnet that distributes bugat v5 and other threats such as the shiz/shifu malware, but this finding is not conclusive because the botnet is used by various affiliates at different times.\n","\n","locky may also have the capability to locate network resources and encrypt files in those locations. ctu researchers are analysing a block of code that may be used to enumerate network-based locations (2016-02-19).\n","\n","locky attempts encryption on the following files and file types:\n","
